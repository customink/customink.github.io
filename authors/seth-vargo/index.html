  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">We recently ran into a situation where we needed to use Chef Search to modify our /etc/hosts file dynamically on each Chef run. Originally seeming to be a relatively simple task, managing the hosts file with Chef rose some interesting challenges. While there are a few existing community-maintained /etc/hosts management cookbooks out there, none of them suited our needs. We wanted a highly customizable, easily expandable, simple, LWRP that was idempotent. In this post, I will discuss creating your own...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">Throughout my internship at CustomInk, I&#39;ve put a significant focus on Chef cookbook testing. At the time of this writing, there are a few solutions for testing cookbooks - ChefSpec, cucumber-chef, minitest-chef-handler, and rspec-chef – and they each have their own distinct advantages. At the very least, you should run knife cookbook test and foodcritic against all your cookbooks. Nathen Harvey covered this in his MVT: knife test and TravisCI blog post. At CustomInk, we test using ChefSpec. Additionally, we use...</p>

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">I was recently working on a gem that involved marshaling data from a remote API. I really wanted the gem to behave like a native Ruby object, but they methods would vary depending on the response. Since the data was dynamic, it would have been counter-productive and not scalable to define each of the methods individually. As such, I thought of a few different ways to get the result I wanted, but that just raised more questions, mainly performance. How...</p>

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">At CustomInk, we use a variety of tools to monitor the status of our builds. One such tool was Greenscreen. In fact, we even wrote a blog post about how we use Greenscreen at CustomInk not too long ago. One of the biggest problems with Greenscreen was its extensibility. By default, Greenscreen only works with Hudson and Jenkins servers. With Travis CI becoming quite popular in the open-source community, Greenscreen needed a major upgrade. Furthermore, Greenscreen was not very extensible....</p>
