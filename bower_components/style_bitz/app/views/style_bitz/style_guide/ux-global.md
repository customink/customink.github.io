The menu pushes the page over on click of the hamburger menu. The user can close the menu by clicking on the page – or navigate by click in an item.

The Menu may also house other utilities beside navigation – for instance Login, Search, BreadCrumb or Group Ordering. The thought is that the menu will be contextual to the page that it is on.

On the large breakpoint, the menu becomes a horizontal module that spans beneath the header. Please note: this still requires design and investigation.
