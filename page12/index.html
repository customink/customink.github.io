  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">The CustomInk technology team would like welcome Jason Gilbertson. Jason, a native of Iowa and a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, has relocated himself to McLean, VA to join our team and we couldn&#39;t be more excited. Like everyone on the CustomInk technology team, Jason was quick to create a feature branch and then deploy his first feature to production. But there is another important aspect of our continuous deployment strategy that Jason participated in: feature verification. When...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">At CustomInk, we use a variety of tools to monitor the status of our builds. One such tool was Greenscreen. In fact, we even wrote a blog post about how we use Greenscreen at CustomInk not too long ago. One of the biggest problems with Greenscreen was its extensibility. By default, Greenscreen only works with Hudson and Jenkins servers. With Travis CI becoming quite popular in the open-source community, Greenscreen needed a major upgrade. Furthermore, Greenscreen was not very extensible....</p>

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">One of the big themes that emerged during #ChefConf was that we should be testing our infrastructure code. Software engineers have been practicing test-driven development, behavior-driven development, continuous integration, and many other testing-related practices for a long time. It&#39;s becoming more important for the infrastructure engineers to learn from and apply these practices to our day-to-day workflow. When it comes to testing Chef-driven infrastructure automation, there are a number of tools and practices that are starting to emerge. In this...</p>

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">If you have ever tried to follow the Opscode Getting Started Guide for Chef, you&#39;ll quickly be overtaken by Chef jargon, confusing instructions, many assumptions, and no clear direction. Even the most experienced developers had a difficult time following the Opscode Wiki. While it serves as a great reference resource, you pretty much have to know Chef before it is of any use. In Part 1 of this 2-part series, we will walk through setting up the Chef environment on...</p>

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">When I first started working with Chef, there were a couple of areas that I knew were going to be really awesome and helpful but I wasn&#39;t sure how to get started with them.  In this presentation, I&#39;ll provide a quick introduction to five things you&#39;ve always wanted to know about Chef but were afraid to ask.

I gave this presentation at #ChefConf 2012.

  <p class="tb-Excerpt-text">At RailsConf 2012, I gave a presentation on how our web operations team enables developer productivity. There&#39;s always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow...</p>
