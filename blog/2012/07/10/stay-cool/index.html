        <h1>Stay Cool</h1>
        <p>We had a fairly severe production issue the other day.  The kind of issue where you get sick to your stomach as you begin to realize what...just....happened......</p>

<p>As the issue escalated, news spread and a core group of people took control to work towards a resolution.  The questions were always &quot;what&#39;s happening&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s changed recently&quot; and &quot;what kinds of things might cause this&quot; and never &quot;who deployed last&quot; and &quot;who worked on this code originally&quot;.  It says a lot about a person that can keep their cool and focus on issue resolution instead of blame assignment.  Even when your tired, punchy, and irritated because you can&#39;t figure out exactly what&#39;s going on, keeping your cool is ultimately the key to success.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It&#39;s really obvious that something is wrong when you see a group of people huddled together all staring intensely at a single monitor and not saying a word.  People instinctively want to ask &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot; and the follow up question is usually &quot;do we know who did that?&quot;.  During our ordeal, teammate after teammate approached and offered simple words &quot;Please let me know what I can do to help&quot;.  Developers, product managers, people from other teams - the skillset each person possessed was irrelevant, but the intent was uniform: help fix the problem in whatever way possible.</p>

<p>When something goes wrong, it doesn&#39;t matter who caused the problem.  Everyone is human, everyone is capable of making the same mistake.  All that matters is &quot;what&quot; is causing the problem.  It&#39;s much easier to find the &quot;what&quot; when your team is calm and working together.  Once you understand the cause of the problem it&#39;s easy to determine a clear plan of action.  With a clear plan of action and a blameless environment, problem resolution is imminent because everyone is ready to help (and not hide).</p>

<p>We&#39;re not completely out of the weeds just yet, but we understand the issue and we our executing our plan of action.  Tomorrow we&#39;ll conduct a blameless postmortem to help us identify, and further prevent, the root cause of the issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m proud to be apart of such a great support system.  I have no gripes about the 16 hours I spent at my computer yesterday because I was helping our customers.  More importantly, I was helping my friends.</p>
